# OS9.css

This is a fork of [Tecate's os9css](https://github.com/Tecate/os9css) with changes to use more Semantic HTML, Removed several classes, and some UI fixes. I've also gotten rid of several unused junk files.

The Demo code is a bit iffy as I didn't work on it too much, but it should be functional enough.
